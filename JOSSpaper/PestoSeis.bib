  abstract = {The perfectly matched layer ͑PML͒ absorbing boundary condition has proven to be very efficient from a numerical point of view for the elastic wave equation to absorb both body waves with nongrazing incidence and surface waves. However, at grazing incidence the classical discrete PML method suffers from large spurious reflections that make it less efficient for instance in the case of very thin mesh slices, in the case of sources located close to the edge of the mesh, and/or in the case of receivers located at very large offset. We demonstrate how to improve the PML at grazing incidence for the differential seismic wave equation based on an unsplit convolution technique. The improved PML has a cost that is similar in terms of memory storage to that of the classical PML. We illustrate the efficiency of this improved convolutional PML based on numerical benchmarks using a finitedifference method on a thin mesh slice for an isotropic material and show that results are significantly improved compared with the classical PML technique. We also show that, as the classical PML, the convolutional technique is intrinsically unstable in the case of some anisotropic materials.},

The CPML equations are expressed as the regular wave equations with additional correction terms, making the integration of the new condition into the existing seismic software relatively easy. Finally, effectiveness of the CPML is demonstrated on the example of a homogenous TTI model. For seismic imaging applications, it should be sufficient to use a 3 layer thick CPML. With as few as 5 layers, reflection coefficients can be reduced to 1\%.},

  abstract = {The fast marching method (FMM) is a grid based numerical scheme for tracking the evolution of monotonically advancing interfaces via finite-difference solution of the eikonal equation. Like many other grid based techniques, FMM is only capable of finding the first-arriving phase in continuous media; however, it distinguishes itself by combining both unconditional stability and rapid computation, making it a truly practical scheme for velocity fields of arbitrary complexity. The aim of this paper is to investigate the potential of FMM for finding later arriving phases in layered media. In particular, we focus on reflections from smooth subhorizontal interfaces that separate regions of continuous velocity variation. The method we adopt for calculating reflected phases involves two stages: the first stage initializes FMM at the source and tracks the incident wave front to all points on the reflector surface; the second stage tracks the reflected wave front by reinitializing FMM from the interface point with minimum traveltime. Layer velocities are described by a regular grid of velocity nodes and layer boundaries are described by a set of interface nodes that may be irregularly distributed. A triangulation routine is used to locally suture interface nodes to neighbouring velocity nodes in order to facilitate the tracking of wave fronts to and from the reflector. A number of synthetic tests are carried out to assess the accuracy, speed and robustness of the new scheme. These include comparisons with analytic solutions and with solutions obtained from a shooting method of ray tracing. The convergence of traveltimes as grid spacing is reduced is also examined. Results from these tests indicate that wave fronts can be accurately tracked with minimal computational effort, even in the presence of complex velocity fields and layer boundaries with high curvature. Incident wave fronts containing gradient discontinuities or shocks also pose no difficulty. Further development of the wave front reinitialization scheme should allow other later arrivals such as multiples to be successfully located.},

  abstract = {A fast marching level set method is presented for monotonically advancing fronts, which leads to an extremely fast scheme for solving the Eikonal equation. Level set methods are numerical techniques for computing the position of propagating fronts. They rely on an initial value partial differential equation for a propagating level set function and use techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. This paper describes a particular case of such methods for interfaces whose speed depends only on local position. The technique works by coupling work on entropy conditions for interface motion, the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast adaptive narrow band level set methods. The technique is applicable to a variety of problems, including shape-from-shading problems, lithographic development calculations in microchip manufacturing, and arrival time problems in control theory.},

  abstract = {An alternative approach to acquire transmission travel time data is proposed, exploiting the geometry of devices commonly used in ultrasound computed tomography for medical imaging or non-destructive testing with ultrasonic waves. The intent is to (i) shorten acquisition time for devices with a large number of emitters, (ii) to eliminate the calibration step, and (iii) to suppress instrument noise. Inspired by seismic ambient field interferometry, the method rests on the active excitation of diffuse ultrasonic wavefields and the extraction of deterministic travel time information by inter-station correlation. To reduce stochastic errors and accelerate convergence, ensemble interferograms are obtained by phase-weighted stacking of observed and computed correlograms, generated with identical realizations of random sources. Mimicking an imaging setup, the accuracy of the travel time measurements as a function of the number of emitters and random realizations can be assessed both analytically and with spectral-element simulations for phantoms mimicking the model parameter distribution. The results warrant tomographic reconstructions with straight- or bent-ray approaches, where the effect of inherent stochastic fluctuations can be made significantly smaller than the effect of subjective choices on regularisation. This work constitutes a first conceptual study and a necessary prelude to future implementations.},

  abstract = {I present a finite-difference method for modeling P-SV wave propagation in heterogeneous media. This is an extension of the method I previously proposed for modeling SH-wave propagation by using velocity and stress in a discrete grid. The two components of the velocity cannot be defined at the same node for a complete staggered grid: the stability condition and the P-wave phase velocity dispersion curve do not depend on the Poisson's ratio, while the S-wave phase velocity dispersion curve behavior is rather insensitive to the Poisson's ratio. Therefore, the same code used for elastic media can be used for liquid media, where S-wave velocity goes to zero, and no special treatment is needed for a liquid-solid interface. Typical physical phenomena arising with P-SV modeling, such as surface waves, are in agreement with analytical results. The weathered-layer and corner-edge models show in seismograms the same converted phases obtained by previous authors. This method gives stable results for step discontinuities, as shown for a liquid layer above an elastic half-space. The head wave preserves the correct amplitude. Finally, the corner-edge model illustrates a more complex geometry for the liquid-solid interface. As the Poisson's ratio v increases from 0.25 to 0.5, the shear converted phases are removed from seismograms and from the time section of the wave field.}
