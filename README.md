**PestoSeis** is a Python package which contains functions for performing simulations in wave physics, with a particular emphasis on seismic applications.  

Some of the of the functionalities within PestoSeis include:

- Straight-ray solver

- Linearized Ray Tomography

-  Acoustic and elastic wave propagation

- Basic exploration seismology processing functions

PestoSeis is primarily aimed at being a piece of educational software and has been written such as to enhance the readability of the code.  While perhaps not as performant as other codes used in seismology, the ease-of-use of PestoSeis make it very well suited for improving one's understanding of fundamental topics in seismology and wave physics.
